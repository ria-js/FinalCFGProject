                        <h2>Testimonial from Sandra</h2>
                        <p>I started practicing mindfulness a couple of years ago when I was referred to a 8-week
                            programme through the NHS. It was hard at first to turn off the inner chatter in my mind,
                            but with practice and acceptance of the fact that my mind was created to think, I have
                            stepped away from a vision of perfectionism to a more fluid way of thinking. I can
                            definitley tell I now take a step back before I let my thoughts go on a tangent. It doesn't
                            just help me be mindful in just my every day emotions, but also how to make food choices in
                            the day, whether I want to attend a social event, and how not to take constructive criticism
                            at work too harshly. I couldn't recommend getting into mindfulness more and there are plenty
                            of free ways to do this. From apps on your phone to YouTube Videos to help you practice. You
                            have no excuse not to start mindfulness mediation, so do it today, and I guarantee you will
                            notice a change in your ways of thinking soon enough.

                    <h2>Testimonial from Darren</h2>
                    <p>I was first introduced to mindfulness and meditation through a workship in my current workplace.
                        I didn't think much of it as first, and when I tried the body cans, I just felt it made me more
                        aware of things going on in my body which I didn't necessarily want to acknowledge. I was
                        suffering with burnout from work a while after this workship and it popped in my mind to perhaps
                        give it another chance. After reading a few websites and watching a few things on the internet
                        surrounding mindfulness, I soon realised I can make this work for me without having to
                        consistantly scan how my body is feeling, but just focusing on my breath. After a few months
                        taking as little as 10 minutes out of my day before my work day, I have noticed a drastic
                        improvement. Once I stepped away from my assumption of it and realised we can pick and choose
                        how we practice mindfulness, this definitely improved my outlook on mindfulness as a whole. If
                        you have tried it in the past and not though much of it, I urge you to give it another chance. I
                        couldn't start my day without my 10 minutes of it in the morning now.

                    <h2>How Mindulness Can Help</h2>
                    <p>Mindfulness improves well-being. Increasing your capacity for mindfulness supports many attitudes
                        that contribute to a satisfied life. Being mindful makes it easier to savor the pleasures in
                        life as they occur, helps you become fully engaged in activities, and creates a greater capacity
                        to deal with adverse events. By focusing on the here and now, many people who practice
                        mindfulness find that they are less likely to get caught up in worries about the future or
                        regrets over the past, are less preoccupied with concerns about success and self-esteem, and are
                        better able to form deep connections with others.

                    <h2>Proven Benefits</h2>
                    <p>Mindfulness improves physical health. If greater well-being isn’t enough of an incentive,
                        scientists have discovered that mindfulness techniques help improve physical health in a number
                        of ways. Mindfulness can: help relieve stress, treat heart disease, lower blood pressure, reduce
                        chronic pain, , improve sleep, and alleviate gastrointestinal difficulties.</p><br>

                    <p>Mindfulness improves mental health. In recent years, psychotherapists have turned to mindfulness
                        meditation as an important element in the treatment of a number of problems, including:
                        depression, substance abuse, eating disorders, couples’ conflicts, anxiety disorders, and
                        obsessive-compulsive disorder.
